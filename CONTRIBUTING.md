# Contributing

So, you want to contribute to this project! That's awesome. However, before doing so, please read the following simple steps how to contribute. 
This will make the life easier and will avoid wasting time on things which are not requested. ✨

## Discuss the changes before doing them

 - First of all, open an issue in the repository, using the [bug tracker](https://github.com/the-1Riddle/Leetcode-c-Solutions/issues),
   describing the contribution you would like to make, the bug you found or any
   other ideas you have. This will help us to get you started on the right
   foot.
   
 - It is recommended to wait for feedback before continuing to next steps.
   However, if the issue is clear (e.g. a typo) and the fix is simple, you can
   continue and fix it.
